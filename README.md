## Single Page Note App in Javascript

For our week 7 challenge at Makers we will be building a one page notes app using plain vanilla javascript and following a TDD approach but without using a testing framework.

Crucially, this JS web app is one page front end only - all the elements that a user interacts with are dynamically modified on the page.
